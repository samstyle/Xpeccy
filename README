How to compile
- install cmake
- open terminal emulator and make this:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
If something going wrong, fix it - install qt4 and sdl libraries and headers
Additionally you need install libz80ex.
Optionally you can install alsa, sdl sound and zlib libs and headers for more functional
And...
	make
Result should be './build/xpeccy' executable file

By default there is only ZX Spectrum 48K romset w/o TRDOS.

PS: DON'T try to build it under Windows. I'm serious.
